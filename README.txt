ParseKit - http://parsekit.com

ParseKit is a Mac OS X Framework written by Todd Ditchendorf in Objective-C 2.0 and released under the MIT Open Source License. ParseKit is suitable for use on Mac OS X Leopard, Snow Leopard or iPhone OS. ParseKit is an Objective-C implementation of the tools described in "Building Parsers with Java" by Steven John Metsker. ParseKit includes additional features beyond the designs from the book and also some changes to match common Cocoa/Objective-C conventions. These changes are relatively superficial, however, and Metsker's book is the best documentation available for ParseKit.

The ParseKit Framework offers 3 basic services of general interest to Cocoa developers:

- String Tokenization via the Objective-C PKTokenizer and PKToken classes.
- High-Level Language Parsing via Objective-C - An Objective-C parser-building API (the PKParser class and sublcasses).
- Objective-C Parser Generation via Grammars - Generate an Objective-C parser for your custom language using a BNF-style grammar syntax (similar to yacc or ANTLR). While parsing, the parser will provide callbacks to your Objective-C code.
